#Linear Regression Model from Kaggle Dataset

This repository contains the code and documentation for building a linear regression model using a sample dataset from Kaggle. The model is implemented in Python, leveraging popular libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

#Project Overview

#The goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of building a linear regression model from start to finish. This includes:

#Importing Required Libraries:
The necessary Python libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook/script.

#Importing Dataset:
The sample dataset from Kaggle is used for training the linear regression model.

#Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

#Feature engineering:
Feature engineering is performed to extract meaningful features from the dataset.

#Data Visualization:
Seaborn is utilized for data visualization to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.

#Standardization:
The values in the dataset are standardized to ensure consistent scaling for the model.

#Model Training:
The linear regression model is trained on the preprocessed and standardized data.

#Model Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2) metrics.
